# Teste-table-filter

> A simple test of sortable and searchable table with AngularJS

### Run the Application

I have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now you can visit http://localhost:8000/app/ to view the application.
